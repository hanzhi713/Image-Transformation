# Image-Transformation
### Perform an arbitrary image transformation by complex mapping
##### You may need to adjust the size of the convolution kernel in order to obtain a smooth destination image
#### Example

![f(z)=z^1.2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\huge%20{f(z)=z^{1.2}})

##### Kernel size = 7x7
